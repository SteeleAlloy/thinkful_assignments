    "To close out this checkpoint, answer the following questions. Once you're done, you can compare your answers to the ones found in this notebook, which you can download.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Let's assume that you have World Bank data on financial, economic and social indicators for several countries. You want to measure the factors that affect the level of development in these countries. To this end, you decide to use per capita income as a proxy for the development level, which is defined as the national income divided by the population. You want to use some features in your dataset to predict per capita income. Is this task a classification or a regression task? Why?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Really, you could go either way on identifying the type of problem that this task is. If you are pretty sure that there is only a specific set range of incomes you could use a classification model. I personally don't think I would approact this problem as a classification task simply because there is such a huge variance in income in the United States. With that said, I would process this as a regression task.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Which of the following arguments are false and why?**\n",
    "    * OLS is a special type of linear regression models- False. OLS isn't a type of regression model itself, more of an algorithm that helps you optimize your model.\n",
    "    * Regression models become useless if they don’t meet the assumptions of linear regression.- True! If they can't meet the basic 6 assumptions we can't perform linear regression on them!\n",
    "    * Estimation and prediction are the same thing in the context of linear regression models.- FALSE! Estimation is actually what we use to make our predictions, so they are not the same things.\n",
    "    * Linear regression is only one kind of regression model. Regression problems can also be solved with other kind of models like Support Vector Machines or Random Forests.True! \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Assume that your project manager wants you to discover which free services your company offers make your customers buy more of your paid services. Formulate this task as a regression problem and write down the potential outcome and features that you’d like to work on.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Target variable = customer purchases of paid products\n",
    "Features = free service A and free service b\n",

    "Assignment: predicting house prices\n",
    "Now, it's your turn to design your first regression model. In this module, you'll be using a version of the \"House Prices\" dataset from Kaggle that we've ported to a Postgres database. This dataset consists of 79 variables describing many aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. Using this data, your task will be to predict the prices of the houses. You can find the descriptions of the variables here: House Prices\n",
